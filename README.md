## Description

### Ajax.js
ES6 JavaScript class which tries to make simpler AJAX requests by making instantiation, opening, sending, and setting methods (for success, error and download progress events) parts of the request more easy and faster to access. It also supports requests chaining and reusing configuration options between requests.
Still in progress. Feel free to suggest anything.
